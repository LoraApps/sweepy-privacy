                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Sweepy (the “App”) is a gallery cleaning and photo/video management tool that runs on your device. This policy explains what permissions the app uses, what data may be processed, third-party services, and your rights.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>Data We Process and Why</h2>
                <div class="box">
                    <p><strong>The App generally does not upload your personal media content to a server.</strong> However, the following types of data may be processed by the app and third-party services:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Media Access:</strong> To access your photos and videos (viewing, compression, deletion, private vault). Media files remain on your device; we do not upload their contents to servers.</li>
                        <li><strong>App Settings & Counters (Local):</strong> Small local data such as daily counters, preferences, and cache are stored in Hive (local database).</li>
                        <li><strong>Analytics & Crash Reporting:</strong> The App may collect usage metrics and crash reports via Firebase Analytics or similar tools. This is used for performance and stability and does not include your personal media content.</li>
                        <li><strong>Advertising Identifiers:</strong> For ads to function, the device Advertising ID and contextual signals may be used; this is processed by Google Mobile Ads.</li>
                        <li><strong>Payments / Subscriptions:</strong> Purchases are handled via RevenueCat (purchases_flutter). Information such as your subscription status is processed by RevenueCat; it is not sent to our own servers.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </section>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>Permissions and How They’re Used</h2>
                <p>The App may request the following Android permissions. Each permission is used only when the related feature is enabled:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>READ_MEDIA_IMAGES / READ_MEDIA_VIDEO:</strong> Required to display and process media in your gallery.</li>
                    <li><strong>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE (legacy APIs):</strong> Used for features that need deleting/writing files (Android 9 and below).</li>
                    <li><strong>INTERNET:</strong> Required for ad delivery, package/config checks, and purchase services.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
                <p>Some features use third-party SDKs and services, which are governed by their own privacy policies:</p>
                <div class="third-party">
                    <div class="badge">Google Mobile Ads (AdMob)</div>
                    <div class="badge">RevenueCat (purchases_flutter)</div>
                    <div class="badge">Firebase (Analytics / Crashlytics)</div>
                    <div class="badge">Hive (local data)</div>
                    <div class="badge">photo_manager (gallery access)</div>
                </div>
                <p style="margin-top:12px">These services may collect data such as personal information or advertising identifiers. For example, ad providers may use the device Advertising ID for targeting. Please refer to the provider’s privacy policy for details.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>Ads and Personalization</h2>
                <p>The App shows ads. Ad providers (e.g., Google) may personalize ads based on device identifiers, location (if permitted), and app usage. You can manage ad preferences in Android ad settings or your device manufacturer’s settings.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>Purchases and Subscriptions</h2>
                <p>In-app purchases are processed via RevenueCat. During purchases, payment information is handled directly by the store (Google Play / App Store); the App and RevenueCat do not receive full payment details. Your purchase/subscription status is stored and enforced by RevenueCat.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>Local Storage and Cache</h2>
                <p>The App stores small amounts of data on your device (Hive): preferences, daily counters, small caches, and app state. This data is typically removed when you uninstall the app, though behavior may vary by device/OS.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The App does not store copies of your media on a server.</li>
                    <li>Files you delete in the app are deleted from the device; Android trash/recycle behavior may vary.</li>
                    <li>If you want to remove local data (settings, counters), uninstall the app; in some cases you may need to clear app data manually (Device settings → Apps).</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>Your Rights</h2>
                <p>Since most data is stored locally in the app, there is typically no central server request needed. For data collected by ad/analytics providers, you can manage preferences and deletion requests via the third party’s controls (e.g., Google settings).</p>
            </section>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
                <p>The App does not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. If you are a parent/guardian and believe data has been collected, please contact us.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>Security</h2>
                <p>The App applies reasonable security measures for local data (e.g., encryption for the in-app private vault). When network transmission is involved (purchase verification, ads), third-party providers’ security practices apply.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>Contact</h2>
                <div class="contact">
